# intent

A simple flutter plugin to deal with Android Intents - your one stop solution for Android Intents, written with :heart:.

Show some :heart: by putting :star:

**`intent` tries to help you in launching another android activity using *Android Intents.* This Dart API replicates Android Intent API, so for detailed information on how to use it efficiently, when to send what kind of data, you may be interested in taking a look [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#intent-structure), which explains things more elaborately.**

`intent` is readily available for [use](https://pub.dev/packages/intent). 

## what does it do ?

### latest addition

**Newest Addition: You can pass extra data's type information, while invoking `Intent.putExtra(String extra, dynamic data, {String type})` as optional named param `type`. You don't even need to hardcode type names as Strings, rather a class named `TypedExtra` has been given to developers, which has all currently supported type names as static variables. Consider using them. And last but not least, this is _not_ a breaking change !!!**

```dart
import 'package:intent/intent.dart' as android_intent;
import 'package:intent/extra.dart' as android_extra;
import 'package:intent/typedExtra.dart' as android_typedExtra;
import 'package:intent/action.dart' as android_action;

// more codes ...

android_intent.Intent()
        ..setAction(android_action.Action.ACTION_SHOW_APP_INFO)
        ..putExtra(android_extra.Extra.EXTRA_PACKAGE_NAME, "com.whatsapp", type: android_typedExtra.TypedExtra.stringExtra)
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```

## how to use it ?
Well make sure, you include `intent` in your `pubspec.yaml`.

### Define a Term :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_DEFINE)
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TEXT, "json")
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Show Desired Application Info :
Make sure you address app using its unique package id.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_SHOW_APP_INFO)
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_PACKAGE_NAME, "com.whatsapp")
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Show Application Preference Activity :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_APPLICATION_PREFERENCES)
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Launch Application Error Reporting Activity :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_APP_ERROR)
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Launch Default Assist Activity :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_ASSIST)
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Report Bug :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_BUG_REPORT)
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### View a URI :
Which activity to be launched, depends upon type of URI passed.

In case of passing `tel` URI, opens dialer up.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_VIEW)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: "tel", path: "123"))
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
``` 
 If you pass a `mailto` URI, it'll open email app.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_VIEW)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: "mailto", path: "someone@example.com"))
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
In case of `http`/ `https` URI, opens browser up.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_VIEW)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: "https", host:"google.com"))
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Dial a Number using Default Dial Activity :
Setting data using `tel` URI, will open dialer, number as input.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_DIAL)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: 'tel', path: '121'))
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
But if you're interested in opening dialer without any numbers dialer, make sure you don't set data field.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_DIAL)
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Calling a Number :
You can simply call a number, but make sure you've necessary permissions to do so.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_CALL)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: 'tel', path: '121'))
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
It'll always be a wise decision to use `ACTION_DIAL`, because that won't require any kind of permissions.

### Create Precomposed Email :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setPackage("com.google.android.gm")
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_SEND);
        ..setType("message/rfc822");
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_EMAIL, ["john.doe@exampleemail.com"]);
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_CC, ["jane.doe@exampleemail.com"]);
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_SUBJECT, "Foo bar");
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TEXT, "Lorem ipsum");
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```

### Create a Document :
Content type of document is set `text/plain`, category is `CATEGORY_OPENABLE` and file name is passed as an extra i.e. `EXTRA_TITLE`.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT)
        ..setType("text/plain")
        ..addCategory(Category.CATEGORY_OPENABLE)
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TITLE, "test.txt")
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
You can also set path of file using data field. But make sure data field is a valid path URI.

### Edit Document :
You can edit image/ text or any other kind of data using appropriate activity.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_EDIT)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: 'content',
                path:
                'path-to-image'))
        ..setType('image/*')
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Add a Contact to your Contact Database :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction('com.android.contacts.action.SHOW_OR_CREATE_CONTACT')
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: 'tel', path: '1234567890'))
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Search for a Term :
Opens up a list of eligible candidates, which can provides search activity.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_SEARCH)
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TEXT, 'json')
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Share Text/ Media :
Make sure you've set appropriate path URI for sharing documents/ media using `EXTRA_STREAM` and also set type properly.

Following one will share a plain text. For sharing html formatted text, set type to `text/html`.
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_SEND)
        ..setType('text/plain')
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TEXT, 'json')
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
But if you're interested in creating a chooser i.e. all eligible candidates shown up system, which can handle this intent, make sure you set `createChooser` named parameter to `true`, which is by default `false`.

### Send Email to certain ID while setting Content and CC/ BCC :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_SENDTO)
        ..setData(Uri(scheme: 'mailto', path: 'anjanroy@yandex.com'))
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_CC, ['someone@example.com'])
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TEXT, 'Hello World')
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Translate a Text using default Assist Activity :
```dart
Intent()
        ..setAction(Action.ACTION_TRANSLATE)
        ..putExtra(Extra.EXTRA_TEXT, "I Love Computers")
        ..startActivity().catchError((e) => print(e));
```
### Pick a Contact up from Phone :
- Opens default Phone Activity and let user pick a contact up, selected contact will be returned as `Future<List<String>>` from `startActivityForResult()`.
```dart
        Intent()
                ..setAction(Action.ACTION_PICK)
                ..setData(Uri.parse('content://contacts'))
                ..setType("vnd.android.cursor.dir/phone_v2")
                ..startActivityForResult().then((data) => print(data),
                onError: (e) => print(e));
```
### Capture Image using default Camera activity :
Path to captured image can be grabbed from `Intent().startActivityForResult().then(() { ... } )`, which will be provided in form of `List<String>`, open file using that path, `File(data[0])`. Now you can work on that image file.
```dart
        Intent()
                ..setAction(Action.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE)
                ..startActivityForResult().then((data) => print(data[0]), // gets you path to image captured
                onError: (e) => print(e));
```
![image_capture_using_intent](image_capture.gif)

If you're not interested in showing default activity launch animation, set following flag.
```dart
Intent()..addFlag(Flag.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
```

If you don't want this activity to be displayed in recents, set following flag.
```dart
Intent()..addFlag(Flag.FLAG_ACTIVITY_EXCLUDE_FROM_RECENTS);
```
If you request for certain Activity and no eligible candidate was found, you'll receive one error message, which you can listen for using `Future.catchError((e) {},)` method.
```
PlatformException(Error, android.content.ActivityNotFoundException: No Activity found to handle Intent { act=android.intent.action.SYSTEM_TUTORIAL }, null)
```

**Currently a limited number of Actions are provided in `Action` class, but you can always use a string constant as an `Action`, which will help you in dealing with many more Activities.**

Hoping this helps :wink:
